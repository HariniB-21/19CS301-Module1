# Experiment No: 3-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - python program for bitwise shift operators on the user given integers

## AIM
 to Write a python program for bitwise shift operators on the user given integers

## ALGORITHM
Start
Input an integer a
Input an integer b
Perform right shift operation:
Calculate a >> b (shift bits of a to the right by b positions)
Print the result
Perform left shift operation:
calculate a << b (shift bits of a to the left by b positions)
Print the result
End

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212222020008
#Name-Harini B
#Write your code here
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print(a>>b)
print(a<<b)
## OUTPUT
