# Experiment No: 1 - Python Basics - Printing Multiline String

## AIM  
To create a Python program to represent strings in multiple formats.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Define a string to be printed in a single line.
2. Define a string that will be split into multiple lines with indentation on the second line.
3. Use the `print()` function to display the strings.
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM

```python
# Reg.No- 
# Name- 

# Write your code here

# Single-line string
result1 = "SaveethaEng"

# Multiline string with indentation on the second line
result2 = """Saveetha
        Eng"""

# Printing the results
print(result1)
print(result2)

```
##  Output

## result
