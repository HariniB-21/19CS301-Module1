## Experiment No: 4 â€“ Conditional Statements- divisible by 11 0r not

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to read a number and check whether the number is divisible by 11 or not using  if else
## ALGORITHM  
1. Algorithm to Check if a Number is Divisible by 11
Start
Input a number a from the user.
Set b = 11.
Check if a % b == 0 (i.e., check if the remainder when a is divided by 11 is zero).
If True, then:
Print "a is divisible by 11".
Else:
Print "a is NOT divisible by 11".
End



## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212222020008
# Name-Harini B
# Write your code here

a=int(input())
b=11
if a%b==0:
    print(a,"is divisible by 11")
else:
    print(a,"is NOT divisible by 11")
   
```
