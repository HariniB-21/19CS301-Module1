# Experiment No: 2- Data Types â€“ Printing Integer Literals

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the following integer literals: 12.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Initialize the integer literals 12  
3. Use the `print()` function to display the numbers 12 
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212222020008
# Name-Harini B
